Hitlerhook `/ˈhɪtlərhʊk/` is a fully-internal Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 
multihack for linux and the predecessor of Project-Spartan. It is a fork of
Fuzion and contains additional features like new Anti-Aims.

Many AimTux and Fuzion-based forks have been detected. Using this cheat
may result in a VAC ban. Use this cheat at your own risk.

Hitlerhook has reached end-of-life and will no longer be supported by the developers.
Users are encouraged to continue and updating this cheat as they like.
